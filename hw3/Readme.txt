 Homework 3
 Spoken language Processing
 Submitted are some extra files as I expected to need them for remote testing and didn't use them.
 
 The runme.sh runs your script to generate the output files don't do this unless you need to regrenearte hte files
 I have tard and zipped the desired output files
 To the extent of my knowledge this is working
 One confusion that was had by many is that your example spreadsheet/matlab programs use a base 2 approximation and you want a base 10 making comparison at first glance not obvious
 I believe I have some minor rounding errors that causes some divergences from the exact values but it appears to be negligable.
 I believe that my Veturbi is accurate however have no way to fully test this.
 Sampling appears to work.
 
 Overall this assignment was confusing not because of any difficult equations but because of not knowing what to expect for output and minor issues like the base of the sample matlab being in base 2 not 10.
